NAME
    Filter::Microsoft - User friendly error messages in Perl

SYNOPSIS
      use Filter::Microsoft;
      open FH, $filename or die "Could not open $filename: $!";

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a drop-in-replacement and can be used in existing scripts
    and modules. It makes $! user friendly, like in Microsoft software.

    $! usually contains technical descriptions like "No such file or
    directory" or "No space left on device". This is useful for developers,
    but users need error messages they understand.

    Microsoft understands users. You may have noticed how user friendly
    Microsoft software is. Because even Microsoft's software has bugs, the
    people in Redmond had to come up with simpler error messages.

    Filter::Microsoft brings those friendly error messages to Perl.

CAVEATS
    User friendly messages are used only when $! is in quotelike operators.
    This allows you to send the real error message over the Internet without
    letting the user know.
